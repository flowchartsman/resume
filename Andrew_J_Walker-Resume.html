                        <p>I am a professional <span class="keyword">Go</span> ("Golang") developer, Google Developer Expert (Go), and full-stack software engineer with over fifteen years of experience, most of it in the security industry. I believe in the aesthetics of software design, and that better security is a proxy to better quality of software overall. I am interested in the future of programming languages as the industry embraces security, concurrency and machine learning as more prominent paradigms.

                        <p>Other areas of professional interest: <span class="keyword">Julia</span>, <span class="keyword">Rust</span>, human/computer interaction, parallel computing, big data, and the structured visual representation of data.</p>
